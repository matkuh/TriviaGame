### I used HTML, CSS, BootStrap, JavaScript, and JQuery to build a Trivia Game.  There are 6 questions, each with 4 possible answers. There is also a timer that counts down from 30 seconds each question.  The game will tally correct answers, incorrect answers, and unanswered answers.
## Tech I Used 

1. [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp)
2. [BootStrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) 
3. [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)
4. [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_css.asp)
5. [JQuery](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp)
